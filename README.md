# task-lists-practice

This repository is a collection of task lists that I am building to increase my skills in certain areas of JavaScript and general front-end skills.

The idea is to build task list after task list and keep implementing more and more features until the muscle memory allows me to have core JavaScript fundamentals on lock.

Initially I am thinking about building one everyday until I have the Fundamentals, DOM manipulation and local and session storage down. I am going to use these to bring my HTML, CSS and JS up to the point where I am comfortable using my skills professionally.
