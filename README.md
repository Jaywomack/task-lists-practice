# task-lists-practice

This repository is a collection of task lists that I am building to increase my skills in certain areas of JavaScript and general front-end skills.

The idea is to build task list after task list and keep implementing more and more features until the muscle memory allows me to have core JavaScript fundamentals on lock.

Initially I am thinking about building one everyday until I have the Fundamentals, DOM manipulation and local and session storage down. I am going to use these to bring my HTML, CSS and JS up to the point where I am comfortable using my skills professionally.

<!-- Task List 1 -->

Task list one was done with a follow along guide. Therefor was quite easy.

<!-- Task List 2 -->

The html and css was a little rusty but I was able to style everything with only looking up the property for removing the bullets in the ul.

The javascript was a different story and was quite difficult. I could remember most the steps but in no way could implement the solution without looking it up step by step. On to task list 3.
